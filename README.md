## 📖 Overview
**OOP’s Way Back Home** is an 8-bit style educational game built in **Godot Engine**.  
You play as **OOP**, an alien who crash-lands on Earth and must retrieve the **four scattered shards of his spaceship**.  
Each shard is hidden in a different country — **Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia** — disguised as cultural relics.
